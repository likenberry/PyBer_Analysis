# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to look at data from a ride sharing company to understand rides differ between different types of cities . The data from this analysis was provided in csv files and was analyzed using Python, Pandas and Jupyter Notebook. Another factor of this analysis was creating visualizations that could accurately and easily display the results. Some of the specific information wanted from this analysis is the number of drivers by city type, the total number of rides by city type, the total amount of fares by city type, the average fare per ride by city type and the average fare per driver.

## Results

This analysis was completed by combining the available csv files into a single DataFrame and isolating the type of city: urban, suburban and rural look at the differences in drivers, number of rides, average fare and average fare per driver.

This is an image of the assembled information regarding how different types of cities change the number of drivers and fares.

- From this image, it is possible to see that rural cities have the lowest number of total rides, drivers and total fares. However, rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. Since there are only 78 drivers for rural cities and there are 125 total rides in rural cites, there are almost twice as many rides per driver meaning that drivers will earn higher average fares than if there were more drivers. Since rural cities are usually more spread out in total area, suburban and urban cities, it makes sense that rural cities would have higher average fares per ride since rides would cover longer distances on average than other city types.
- Suburban cities has more total drivers, rides and fares than rural citeis but less average fare per driver and average fare per ride than rural cities. The suburban cities also have almost five times values of the rural cities. There were 625 total rides and 490 total drivers for suburban cities which is closer to a 6 to 5 ratio meaning that there are still more rides than available drivers and therefore less average fare per drivers and less average fare per ride than rural cities. However, drivers in suburban cities have much higher fares than drivers in urban cities.
- Urban cities have the highest total rides, drivers and fares of the three city types. Urban cities also have the least average fare per driver and fare per ride. There are 1625 total rides for 2405 drivers in urban cities which is almost a third more drivers than rides meaning that there are way more drivers than rides which is why urban drivers have the lowest average fare. It can also be implied that rides in urban cities are probably shorter than those in suburban and rural cities based on the fact that urban cities are usually compact in total area and the average fare per ride is lowest of the three city types. With almost five times as many drivers for urban cities than for suburban cities, urban cities total fare ($39,854.38) is only about twice as much as suburban cities fare ($19,356.33).

This image is visualiztion of the change in fares by city type over time. Urban cities have the fares consistently over time, with suburban cities in the middle and rural cities with the lowest fare total fares consistently over time. This image shows four total months of fares from 2019. All three city types show the same general trends except suburban cities which has a slight spike in late February and is trending upward at the end of April. The changes in fares over the course of time could be related to holidays which seem to have more impact in suburban and urban cities as a opposed to rural cities.

## Summary

Based on this analysis, the drivers in rural cities make the most off of fares due to the lack of total drivers and average length of the rides. Increasing the number of drivers in rural cities would decrease the average fares similar to larger cities. Higher fares would be a good incentive to add more drivers to areas if they are needed. It appears that there are too many drivers for urban cities and decreasing the number of drivers would increase the total fares for drivers but still meet the demand for the number of rides. It would be helpful to consider the total number of each type of city in this analysis since there are less rural cities than urban cities which could influence this analysis. This is also a general analysis based off of city type but it might be helpful to sample some of the indiviual cities from each type to see if the trends noticed in this analysis still apply on a single city level. It might be a good idea to put an emphasis on suburban cities to try and increase the number of rides and accordingly increase the number of drivers. The reason for this is that, suburban cities still have fairly high average fare per driver and average fare per ride meaning that it is still a good incentive to drive in suburban areas and with expanding suburban areas there will be more need. Suburban areas would be a good city size to increase advertising from a profits standpoint since suburban areas are still spread out enough to have longer rides than urban areas and therefore have better fares for drivers. One factor that might increase the number of rides in rural areas would be to offer a carpool option that would allow people to share rides which would make the ride less expensive for them but still have higher average fares for the driver making it beneficial for the rider and the driver.
